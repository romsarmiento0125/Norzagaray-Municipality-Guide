# Norzagaray Municipality Guide (NMG)

The Norzagaray Municipality Guide (NMG) is a project I undertook during my time as a student. It was designed to make a positive impact in the Norzagaray community, primarily by improving the experience of tourists visiting Norzagaray and helping them discover its local attractions, culture, and history.

## Project Overview

NMG serves as a digital guide for tourists, helping them discover:

- Popular attractions and top spots in Norzagaray
- Recommended hotels and accommodations
- Must-visit destinations within the municipality

With this project, we hope to make it easier for visitors to find the best places to visit and stay, thereby contributing to the growth and vibrancy of Norzagarayâ€™s tourism sector.

## Features
